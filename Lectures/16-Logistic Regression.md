### Logistic Regression Model

- **Linear Equation**: 
  $$\[
  Y = b_0 + b_1 \cdot X
  \]$$

- **Sigmoid Function**: 
  $$\[
  P = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-Y}}
  \]$$

#### Graphical Representation

The graph illustrates how logistic regression classifies data points into two categories using predicted probabilities:
- Red 'X' marks represent classified data points.
- The horizontal axis signifies an independent variable.
- The vertical axis shows predicted probabilities ranging from 0 to 1.

**Once the Linear Equation is passed into sigmoid function it turns it into 0-1 classifier as seen in the picture**
