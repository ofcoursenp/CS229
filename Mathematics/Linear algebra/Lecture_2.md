# Row Vectors:

A row vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers arranged horizontally.
It has a single row and multiple columns.
For example, if we have a row vector A represented as A=[a1​,a2​,a3​,a4​,a5​]
, it means that A has 1 row and 5 columns (denoted as (1,5)).



# Column Vectors:

A column vector is also a one-dimensional array of numbers, but it is arranged vertically.
It has multiple rows and a single column.
For the same vector A, if we stack its entries vertically, it becomes :

Here, A has 5 rows and 1 column (denoted as (5,1)).

# Matrix ‘A’:
The matrix has 4 rows and 3 columns.
The elements within the matrix are numbered sequentially from left to right and top to bottom (1 to 12).
Each element is denoted as (A_{ij}), where (i) represents the row number and (j) represents the column number.

# Expanded Form:
On the right side of the matrix, there’s an expanded form showing how each element is denoted.
For example:
(A_{11}) corresponds to the element in the first row and first column.
(A_{23}) corresponds to the element in the second row and third column.

# Dimension:
The matrix ‘A’ is described as having dimensions (4 x 3) (4 rows by 3 columns).

# Matrices A and B:
Vector A: A = [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5]
<br>
Vector B: B = ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bd53636-6448-4c24-a92c-926884d6613d)


# Transposed Matrices:
Transpose of Vector A (A^T): A^T = ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9766490-f8ac-4dba-9a00-610a9dac6344)
 (arranged vertically)
 <br>
Transpose of Vector B (B^T): B^T = [b1, b2, b3, b4, b5] (arranged horizontally)

# Explanation:
When we transpose a Vector, we swap its rows with columns (and vice versa).
<br>
A^T has the same elements as A, but arranged vertically.
<br>
B^T has the same elements as B, but arranged horizontally.
