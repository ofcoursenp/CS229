# **Equations:** 
There are two sets of equations.

Each set defines three variables: A, B, and C.

In both sets, A is a list of five elements: (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4,) and (a_5).

B is also a list of elements: in the first set, there are five elements (b_1) to (b_5); in the second set, there are only four elements (b_1) to (b_4).
C is the result of element-wise addition of lists A and B.

# **Element-Wise Addition:**

In the first set: [C = [a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, a_3 + b_3, a_4 + b_4, a_5 + b_5]]

In the second set: [C = [a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, a_3 + b_3, a_4 + b_4]]

However, In the second set C the elements are uneven so the matrix addition cant occur
