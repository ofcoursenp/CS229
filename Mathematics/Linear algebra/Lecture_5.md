**Graph on the Left**

* 2D Plane: This is a 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with x-axis and y-axis.
* Line: The blue line represents a linear equation 𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥 + 𝐶 y=mx+C, where 𝑚 is the slope and 𝐶 is the y-intercept.
* Intercept 𝐶: The red brace indicates the y-intercept, which is the value of 𝑦 when 𝑥=0.

**Equations on the Right**

* The 3D graph displays a coordinate system with three axes (x, y, and z).

* A blue plane is positioned within this 3D space.
  
* Two distinct groups of points are visible:
   * The red points appear to be above the plane.
   * The green points seem to be below the plane.

**Equations:**

* The text on the right side provides mathematical equations:

* Line Equation:
      * y=m⋅x+c

* Plane Equation:
     * w1​(x1​)+w2​(x2​)+w3​(x3​)+c=0
