# **2-Dimensional Space (2-D):**
-> Imagine a flat plane with two perpendicular axes: the X-axis and the Y-axis.
>
-> A point in this space is represented by its coordinates (x, y).
>
-> For example, the point (4, 5) is plotted at 4 units along the X-axis and 5 units along the Y-axis.

<br>

# **3-Dimensional Space (3-D):**
-> Now add a third axis, the Z-axis, perpendicular to the X and Y axes.
>
-> A point in 3-D space has coordinates (x, y, z).
>
-> For instance, the point (2, 3, 5) is located 2 units along the X-axis, 3 units along the Y-axis, and 5 units along the Z-axis.

<br>

# **Higher Dimensions:**
>
-> We can extend this concept to higher dimensions, denoted as “n-D.”
>
-> In n-D space, a point is represented by (x₁, x₂, …, xₙ), where each xᵢ corresponds to a specific axis.

# **Two-Dimensional (2-D) Space:**

On the left side of the image, we have a 2-D Cartesian coordinate system with axes labeled X and Y.
There are two points:

Point A: Coordinates (4, 5)
Point B: Coordinates (a, b)


The dashed line connects Point A to Point B, forming a right triangle with the origin (0, 0).
The distance formula for 2-D space is:Distance=(a2+b2)​



# **Three-Dimensional (3-D) Space:**

On the right side of the image, we see a 3-D Cartesian coordinate system with axes labeled x, y, and z.
There are two points:

Point C: Coordinates (a, b, c)
Point D: Coordinates (1, 2, 3)


The lines connecting Point C to Point D form the edges of a rectangular prism with one corner at the origin.
The distance formula for 3-D space is:Distance=(a2+b2+c2)​




# **Generalized Distance Formula (n-Dimensions):**

The extended version of the distance formula applies to n-dimensional spaces:Distance=(a2+b2+c2+....+n2)​


# **Distance between 2 points**

# **Graphical Representation:**
The image depicts a two-dimensional coordinate system with labeled axes: X and Y.
There are two points, A and B, represented on the graph.
Point A has coordinates ((a_1, a_2)), and point B has coordinates ((b_1, b_2)).
A line segment connects points A and B, indicating the distance between them.

# **Distance Formulas:**
The image provides two distance formulas:
For 3-D space: Distance Formula = sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2 + (a_3 - b_3)^2}
For n-D space (where n represents any positive integer): {Distance Formula} = sqrt{sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_i - b_i)^2}
