Vector A: Originating from the point (0,0), it is labeled as A(a1, a2).

Vector B: Also originating from the origin, it is labeled as B(b1, b2).

**Perpendicularity:**

The two vectors form a right angle (90 degrees) between them, indicating that they are perpendicular to each other.

When vectors are perpendicular, their dot product equals zero.

**Mathematical Formula:**

**The formula shown is for the dot product of two vectors:**

Since cos 90 is 0 the multipication results in 0 
Hence,

**Vectors A and B:**

The diagram shows two vectors, A and B, represented by arrows.

* Vector A is depicted in red, pointing upwards and to the right.

* Vector B is shown in blue, pointing directly to the right.

* The point of origin for both vectors is labeled with coordinates (a1, a2) for vector A and (b1, b2) for vector B.

**Projection Concept:**

* The dotted line perpendicular to vector B represents the distance from the tip of vector A to vector B.

* This demonstrates the concept of projection, where we find the length of the component of one vector along another.

**Mathematical Expressions:**

The slide includes three mathematical expressions:

Distance = ||A|| * Cos(θ)

A*B = ||A|| * ||B|| * Cos(θ)

Distance = (A*B) / ||B||

These formulas help calculate the projection distance and the dot product between vectors.
