The graph represents a function (Y = f(X)) along with its corresponding derivative $$(\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{df}{dx} = y’)$$ . Here’s what we can infer:

**Function Curve (Y = f(X)):**

* The curve represents the function (Y = f(X)). As (X) changes, the value of (Y) varies.

* The curve peaks and then descends, indicating a maximum or minimum point.


**Derivative (Rate of Change):**

* The derivative $$(\frac{dy}{dx}) (or (y’))$$ measures the rate of change of (Y) with respect to (X).

* It tells us how quickly the function value changes as we move along the curve.


**Interval of Interest:**

* The vertical dashed lines at points $$(X_1)$$ and $$(X_2)$$ define an interval.

* We’re examining the rate of change within this interval.

**Change in Function Value:**

* The horizontal dashed lines at points $$(Y_1)$$ and $$(Y_2)$$ represent the change in function value.

* Specifically, $$(Y_2 - Y_1)$$ gives us the difference in (Y) over the interval.

**Calculating the Derivative:**

The derivative can be calculated as: $$[ y’ = \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X} = \tan \theta ]$$ where $$(\Delta Y)$$ is the change in (Y) and $$(\Delta X)$$ is the change in (X).
