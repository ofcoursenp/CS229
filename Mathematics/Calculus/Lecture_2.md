# Differentiation rules

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7d98546-b664-4463-a77d-a76f94db88cc)


**Constant Rule:**

The derivative of a constant ( c ) with respect to ( x ) is 0: $$[ \frac{d}{dx}© = 0 ]$$


**Power Rule:**

The derivative of $$( x^n )$$ with respect to ( x ) is $$( nx^{n-1} )$$, where ( n ) is any real number: $$[ \frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1} ]$$

**Exponential Rule:**

The derivative of the exponential function $$( e^x )$$ with respect to $$( x )$$ is itself: $$[ \frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x ]$$

**Natural Logarithm Rule:**

The derivative of the natural logarithm function $$( \ln(x) )$$ with respect to $$( x )$$ is the reciprocal of $$( x )$$: $$[ \frac{d}{dx}(\ln(x)) = \frac{1}{x} \quad \text{for } x > 0 ]$$

**Sine Rule:**

The derivative of the sine function $$( \sin(x) )$$ with respect to $$( x )$$ is the cosine function: $$[ \frac{d}{dx}(\sin(x)) = \cos(x) ]$$

**Cosine Rule:**

The derivative of the cosine function $$( \cos(x) )$$ with respect to $$( x )$$ is the negative sine function: $$[ \frac{d}{dx}(\cos(x)) = -\sin(x) ]$$

# Chain Rule

Consider the function:

$$[ y = (3x^2 - 5)^{\frac{1}{2}} ]$$

We’ll use the Chain Rule to find $$(\frac{dy}{dx})$$. First, let’s define (u):

$$[ u = 3x^2 - 5 ]$$

Now, we apply the Chain Rule:

$$[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} ]$$

Find $$(\frac{dy}{du})$$: $$[ \frac{dy}{du} = \frac{1}{2}u^{-\frac{1}{2}} ]$$

Find $$(\frac{du}{dx}): [ \frac{du}{dx} = 6x ]$$

Multiply them together: $$[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3x}{\sqrt{3x^2 - 5}} ]$$

And there you have it! The derivative of (y) with respect to (x) is $$(\frac{3x}{\sqrt{3x^2 - 5}})$$.
