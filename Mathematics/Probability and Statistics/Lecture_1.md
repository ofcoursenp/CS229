**How do we find out the probablity of the black dot being in versicolor or virginia?**

# **Lets take a different example**

**List of Salaries:**

Employee 1: 30,000

Employee 2: 30,500

Employee 3: 32,000

Employee 4: 29,000

Employee 5: 30,000

Employee 6: 29,500

Employee 7: 80,000

* **Sum of Salaries:**
**The sum of all the salaries is:**
30,000 + 30,500 + 32,000 + 29,000 + 30,000 + 29,500 + 80,000 = 261,000

* **Mean Salary Calculation:**
The mean (average) salary is calculated by dividing the total sum of salaries by the number of employees:

**Another value, 30,166.71, is shown for comparison. This might represent the mean salary excluding the outlier (Employee 7 with 80,000). To verify this, calculate the mean without the outlier:**

This demonstrates how an outlier (in this case, the much higher salary of Employee 7) can significantly raise the average, making it less representative of the typical salary in the group.
